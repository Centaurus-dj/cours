Theme:  Imagine you're a journalist presenting one of Banksy's work for your TV Channel.
  (description, meaning, message in relation to Art and Power)
  There are a few passers-by and you ask for their reactions (NB the reactions should be a little developed)

Painting choosed:

    The one with "Follow your dreams" with "CANCELED" on it.

1st Draft:

  Today's subject is one of Banksy's works. I call it "Your dreams are cancelled".
  It's showing a worker, with posters under his left arm, who stopped near what seems an old speech painted on a wall and he had glued a "cancelled" poster on it.
  The purpose behind Banksy's work is to denounce the boundaries the capitalist society is putting the people in. [needs to develop more]
  The fact the rich people
  Now, it became difficult to achieve his dream on the contrary of before where anyone was able to make his dream come true just by working hard.
