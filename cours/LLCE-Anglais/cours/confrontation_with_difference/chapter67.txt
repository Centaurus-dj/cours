Chapter 67

  Some pupils rewrote the passage in which Christopher speaks to Mrs Alexander from her perspective.
  We compared both version of the dialogue and noted that Christopher seemed distant and even rude/impolite
  as it is difficult to understand his behavior without access to his mind.
  It is therefore the access to hidden thoughts and feelings thzt helps the reader to understand him
  and empathize with him, moreover we aware of the fact that he "does" not like talking to stangers so
  the fact that he overcomes his poor social skills/social difficulties in communicating makes him all
  the more so endearing.
