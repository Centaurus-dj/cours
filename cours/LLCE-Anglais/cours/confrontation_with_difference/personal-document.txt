The Hound of Baskervilles


  The Hound of Baskervilles is the third of the four novels about the detective Sherlock Holmes written
  by Arthur Conan Doyle.
  Originally serialised in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902.

  The plot takes place on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an attempted
  murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin.
  Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson investigates the case.
  This was the first appearance of Holmes since his presumed death in "The Final Problem",
  the previous novel, and the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's
  eventual revival.

  I pretty much like the novel even if I couldn't read the entirety of it but from the 20 pages
  I could read I think the main character, Sherlock Holmes, can be said to be a little autistic
  with his mathematics-based and proof-based view of things. He has a view based on scientific
  facts and has a great power of deduction. His train of thoughts are likely to be said different
  from the one the common people has. It's what makes him special when we follow his thoughts,
  the things we think can be uninteresting or help the situation the main character is in sometimes
  appear to be what helps him to find a solution to the issue he's having.
