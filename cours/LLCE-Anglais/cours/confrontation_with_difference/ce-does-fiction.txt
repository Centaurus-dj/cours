  The article is about short-term studies
  trying to understand the effect of reading
  novels on the humans and their behaviour,
  they talk about having the fiction novels
  a greater effect on the minds of the reader
  than non-fictional novels.

  It finally comes to the conclusion that reading
  novels can be of a great help and the ones who
  read a lot are maybe the ones who understands
  the human beings the better but it still warns us
  that having done short-term studies aren't enough
  for us to clearly demonstrates the veracity of the
  studies and we still need to conduct a long-term study
  to have a better point of view about the possible
  changes which can appear after reading novels.

  A laboratory called Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab
  made a study and demonstrated that our brain works harder
  when we read fiction than when we read non-fiction novels.
  The part of our brain which is activated while reading is the
  part used to work out what other people are thinking.
  It means, probably, the more someone read fiction novels the greater
  are the chances to deduct what other people are thinking.
