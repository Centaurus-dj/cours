Notes Jade:


Jade's recording:

  Mark Addon interviewed.
  Christopher -> main character
  boy autistic: has simple voice
  quote from Virginia Wolf -> indirect intertextuality
  The story -> full of paradoxes.

The narrator is a reliable narrator 'cause he can't lie.
An unreliable narrator is a narrator we can't trust.

Doriane's recording:

  disable people -> adults and children with mental handicaps
  needed help people
  centre of attention because of coming out of a prestigious university. (Oxford)
  helped to forget his own problems
  He needed to do a real job ... gain some sort of compensation (?)

Anais's recording:

  Help but wonder how to write a book for Christopher
  Parent -> child a life project
  One of them is very devoted to one.
  Mark Addon doesn't have dog but cat.
  He finds it funny 'cause Christopher doesn't understand why things are sad.
  mc is emotionless.
  mc's parents broke 'cause his mother cheated on his dad.
  Sometimes parents break when they have a disabled child.

positive reviews: theatre adaptation
