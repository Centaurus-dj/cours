    """

## Answer in English:

    """
        I think it's important to preserve the history of mankind, it's mainly for trying not to repeat the same errors/problems we already passed through.
        All the conflicts we had can serve us as a warning when we try to do somehting dangerous, a warning that dictates us what we should do and what we should not try to do.
        What makes the history of mankind is the combination of every main events which happened in every country but the History, with a great 'H', isn't
        really the same thing, it's the conglomerate of history of each country and everyone should be able to learn what happened in their own country.
        
        The past of the country someone lives in is a non-negligable part of its identity, how the citizens of a country reacts to an event or to a stranger or
        a citizen of another country is influenced by the history they all share. 
        If one day in their past there had a conflict between a certain country and their country and the outcome of it wasn't really comprehended or accepted
        by them, they can surely still have grudges against the citizens of this country.
