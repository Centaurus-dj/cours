1)
  It's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.
2)
  u[n] = u[0] + 1*n

3)
  u[10] = u[0] + 1*10
        = 25 + 10
        = 35

  The 1st row where they can all sit in the same row is the 11th row.

4)
  u[31] = u[0] + 1*31
        = 25 + 31
        = 56

  Sigma = 32 * ((u[0] + u[31]) /2)
        = 32 * ((25 + 56) /2)
        = 1296

  The total number of seats in the concert hall is 1296.
